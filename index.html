<h2>Hi,</h2>
    <p> You shouldn't be here. Not to say that I don't want you here, but this website <i>should</i> be private. You can stay if you want. I'm kind of glad you're here, actually. We're like strangers bumping into each other on the subway. Isn't that ironic? I mean, it's a coincidence also, that things happened to work out the way they did. But it's so sad to me that there's so many people around us in the city, and we never talk to one another. So us meeting here is kind of neat, right? </p>
    <p>I want to be forgotten. Or, I mean, I don't care so much to be remembered. Everybody I know is working hard to leave some kind of a mark on this world, going to college to make a difference. Me, I'm still at home, working at a crummy Dominoes. I don't mind. I already have a website, so I already have a leg up on everybody else. So even if I stay a nobody, at least I'll be remembered on a server. Or maybe you just remember me in a few months. Either way, I'll still be here. Nobody wants to be completely forgotten. </p>
